# Hi there, I'm Boyu Wang 👋

I'm a passionate **Computer Science graduate** from University College Dublin 🇮🇪 (First Class Honours).  
I enjoy building **full-stack applications** 🖥️ and exploring cloud and distributed systems ☁️.

I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science** at UCD with a GPA of 3.75, demonstrating both adaptability and strong technical understanding.  
During my studies, I collaborated on several full-stack projects using technologies like React, Spring Boot, and Flask, gaining solid hands-on experience across the entire development stack.

These experiences not only strengthened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team, communicate clearly, and adapt quickly to new technologies and challenges.  
I strongly believe in learning by doing — I enjoy solving problems, building things from scratch, and turning abstract ideas into real-world solutions.  
Now, I'm excited to bring both my technical expertise and strong soft skills into real-world software engineering roles.

## 🗺️ Featured Project: Tourwise

**Tourwise** is a smart tourist guide platform designed to enhance travel experiences for visitors in Manhattan.  
Built with **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **PostgreSQL**, and **React**, it provides users with personalized itineraries and real-time updates by integrating external APIs for weather and events.

Key features include:
- **Map Integration:** Display users' real-time location via GPS and show nearby Points of Interest (POIs) within a dynamic radius.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Integrate weather forecasts and predict crowd densities at POIs based on historical and research-based models, considering distance and time variations.
- **Recommendation System:** Rank POIs based on proximity, user preferences, and affiliate business priorities to deliver tailored suggestions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure a seamless experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Development and Deployment:** Implement automated deployment pipelines for faster development and testing cycles, with reliable testing protocols and strict adherence to clean coding practices.
