# Hi there, I'm Boyu Wang 👋

I'm a passionate **Computer Science graduate** from University College Dublin 🇮🇪 (First Class Honours).  
I enjoy building **full-stack applications** 🖥️ and exploring cloud and distributed systems ☁️.

I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science** at UCD with a GPA of 3.75, demonstrating both adaptability and strong technical understanding.  
During my studies, I collaborated on several full-stack projects using technologies like React, Spring Boot, and Flask, gaining solid hands-on experience across the entire development stack.

These experiences not only strengthened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work effectively in a team, communicate clearly, and adapt quickly to new technologies and challenges.  
I strongly believe in learning by doing — I enjoy solving problems, building things from scratch, and turning abstract ideas into real-world solutions.  
Now, I'm excited to bring both my technical expertise and strong soft skills into real-world software engineering roles.
